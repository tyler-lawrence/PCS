A group of hometown friends organizing a league for League of Legends. The tentative plan is to have 6 teams with 5 members each. The teams were drafted by captains (selected based on rank and familiarity with the players). Each team will play 3 matches every week for five weeks. At the end of the season play there will be a tournament for the top 4 teams. Each leg of the tournament will be decided by a best of 5.
